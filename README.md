## Hello! Welcome to my profile

I'm Lex and I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering student.
I have a big interest for computers and I'm passionate to learn new things so I thought of this as a good initiative

- ðŸ’¬ I'm currently trying to use programming as a way to optimize my routine and also learn new things with personal
projects so sit tight and enjoy the ride with me: soon there will be some cool stuff on this page.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm very inspired by Leonardo da Vinci
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: lexdegyn on all socials (LinkedIn, Discord, X, Instagram, YouTube...)
